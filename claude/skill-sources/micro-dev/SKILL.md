Portable across Claude Code, Antigravity (`agy`), and Gemini CLI.

# micro-dev

Act as a senior engineer who refuses to write code before the success criteria are written down.

## Overview

This skill turns a small, vague dev request into a **verifiable plan**: ambiguity check → scope → verifier → plan.

It **writes** the plan and executes fast-path tasks. Every task with a `PLAN.md` is handed to `executing-micro-plans`, which owns execution identically on every harness.

Core principles:
- **Verifier-first**: success criteria before the first line of code.
- **Surgical**: touch only what is required; delete what you replace.
- **Binary**: every criterion is pass/fail, proved by a command.
- **Stop over guess**: an unclear task is a question, not an assumption.

## When to Use

Tasks touching roughly 1-5 files with an outcome that is already understood: bug fix, small feature, one-file refactor, config tweak, guarded edge case.

| Situation | Use instead |
|---|---|
| Multi-phase feature, architecture, roadmap | GSD (`/gsd:new-project`, `/gsd:plan-phase`) |
| Genuinely ambiguous ask needing discussion | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Failure whose cause is unknown | `superpowers:systematic-debugging`, then this skill for the fix |
| A `PLAN.md` that already exists | `executing-micro-plans` |

## Quick Reference

| Decision | Rule |
|---|---|
| Fast path or full plan? | All four fast-path boxes checked → fast path. Otherwise full plan. |
| Where does the plan live? | `docs/micro/<YYYYMMDD>-<slug>/PLAN.md` while active, `docs/micro/archive/<YYYY-MM>/` once done |
| Has this area been touched before? | `grep -i '<keyword>' docs/micro/INDEX.md` — see Finding Past Plans |
| How many steps? | 3-7. More → not micro, reconsider GSD. |
| Who executes? | Fast path: this skill. Full plan: `executing-micro-plans`. |
| When to commit? | Never automatically. |

**Before writing your first plan, read `references/EXAMPLES.md`** — three worked plans (bug fix, mini-feature, refactor). Matching their shape is faster and more reliable than deriving it from the template alone.

## Output Format

The deliverable is one markdown file whose section headings are fixed. Do not rename, reorder, merge, or drop sections — `executing-micro-plans` reads them by name on the other harness.

```markdown
---
task: <one-line description>
description: <keyword-dense one-liner: what changed, in which files/area, with which technology — written for grep/mgrep search, not for a human reading the plan top to bottom>
status: planned
created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
---

# <task title>

## Context
- Existing code checked: <what was found / files involved>
- Fresh info looked up: <library/API researched, or "n/a">
- Git status checked: clean / <what was found and how it was handled>

## Simpler Alternative Considered
<the simpler approach, or "none — request is already the minimal change">

## Surgical Scope
- **Files touched**: [exact list]
- **Files NOT touched**: [list or "all others"]
- **Symbols replaced** (→ to delete before done): [list or "none"]
- **Symbols extended** (→ keep): [list or "none"]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Build passes: `<exact command>`
- [ ] Tests pass: `<exact command or "n/a — no tests for this path">`
- [ ] No dead code: <replaced symbols confirmed removed, or "n/a — none replaced">
- [ ] Type check: `<exact command or "n/a">`
- [ ] Manual check: `<UI/API action or "n/a">`

## Steps
- [ ] Step 1: <concrete action>
- [ ] Step 2: <concrete action>
- [ ] Step N (teardown): Delete all dead code created by this plan. Run an orphan scan bounded to the replaced symbols. Confirm 0 orphans.

## Code Review
- Dead code removed: yes / no (list remaining if no)
- Build status: pass / fail (fix applied if fail)
- Type errors: none / fixed (describe)
- Unintended side effects: none / (describe)
- Security surface touched: no / yes (semgrep run: pass/fail)
- Verdict: ✅ DONE / ⚠️ BLOCKED (reason)

## Execution Log
(append-only, filled by executing-micro-plans)

## Notes
(deviations from plan, errors hit, corrections made)
```

`references/PLAN_TEMPLATE.md` is the same structure with inline guidance, ready to copy.

**`status`** is exactly one of `planned`, `blocked`, `done` — never `complete` or `completed`. The archive sweep matches `done` literally.

**`description`** exists for search, not for the reader. `task` is what a human sees in a listing; `description` is what a `grep`/`mgrep` query matches months later — pack in the symptom, the area touched, and any library/API name, even ones already in `task`.

## Plan Index

Every full plan (not fast-path tasks — those stay in `DAILY_LOG`) gets one line in `docs/micro/INDEX.md`, created with a `# Micro-dev Plan Index` header if missing:

```markdown
- [20261002-fix-metadata-keyerror](20261002-fix-metadata-keyerror/PLAN.md) — Fix KeyError on missing metadata field in the document router
```

Append the line when the plan file is created (frontmatter `status: planned`), using the folder slug and the `description` value. Link paths are relative to `docs/micro/`, where the index lives. Never rewrite existing lines when revisiting a plan — append-only, like the Execution Log. The one exception is the archive sweep, which rewrites the link path of a plan it moves; the description is never touched.

The index covers every full plan, active and archived, so it is the single entry point for search. It grows by one line per plan: query it with `grep`, never read it whole.

## Plan File Location

```
docs/micro/
├── INDEX.md                         one line per full plan, active and archived
├── DAILY_LOG-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md        fast-path log, current month only
├── <YYYYMMDD>-<slug>/PLAN.md        active plans: planned or blocked
└── archive/<YYYY-MM>/
    ├── <YYYYMMDD>-<slug>/PLAN.md    done plans, bucketed by the month in their folder name
    └── DAILY_LOG-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md    past months' logs
```

One folder per task, one plan inside it. Always forward slashes. The root holds only what is in flight; monthly buckets keep every directory small no matter how many plans accumulate.

**Slug**: derive from the task description, lowercase, `[a-z0-9-]` only, max 60 chars, no `..` and no `/`. Validate against `^[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$` **before** the slug reaches any shell command.

Resolve the slug first, then run the command with the real value substituted. For the slug `fix-metadata-keyerror`:

```bash
mkdir -p "docs/micro/$(date +%Y%m%d)-fix-metadata-keyerror"
```

Never execute a command that still contains a `<placeholder>`.

## Archive Sweep

Run at step 2 of every invocation, fast path included. It moves finished work out of the root:

- a plan folder at the root whose frontmatter reads `status: done` → `archive/<YYYY-MM>/`, and its `INDEX.md` link is rewritten to the new path;
- a `DAILY_LOG` from a month before the current one → `archive/<YYYY-MM>/`.

`planned` and `blocked` plans never move. Neither does a folder whose name does not match `^[0-9]{8}-[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$` — names read from disk are sanitized before they reach a shell command. `executing-micro-plans` never moves a plan: closing a plan leaves it at the root, where the user sees it, until the next sweep.

The sweep runs in two stages: a read-only listing, then one explicit command per item. Never fold the moves into a loop — a script that loops over `mv` and rewrites files with `sed` gets refused by permission classifiers, and redoing it by hand costs more than the two stages. Most invocations find nothing to move, and the listing alone then costs one call.

**Stage 1 — list (read-only).** Prints one line per item to move, nothing otherwise:

```bash
cur="$(date +%Y-%m)"
for d in docs/micro/[0-9]*-*/; do
  d="${d%/}"; n="${d#docs/micro/}"
  printf '%s' "$n" | grep -qE '^[0-9]{8}-[a-z0-9-]{1,60}$' || continue
  head -n 8 "$d/PLAN.md" 2>/dev/null | grep -qE '^status: *done *$' || continue
  echo "plan $n archive/$(printf '%s' "$n" | cut -c1-4)-$(printf '%s' "$n" | cut -c5-6)"
done
for f in docs/micro/DAILY_LOG-*.md; do
  [ -e "$f" ] || continue
  n="${f#docs/micro/}"; m="${n#DAILY_LOG-}"; m="${m%-??.md}"
  printf '%s' "$m" | grep -qE '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}$' || continue
  [ "$m" = "$cur" ] || echo "log $n archive/$m"
done
```

**Stage 2 — move, one command per listed line**, with the real values substituted. For `plan 20260905-fix-currency-format archive/2026-09`:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/micro/archive/2026-09 && git mv docs/micro/20260905-fix-currency-format docs/micro/archive/2026-09/
```

Use plain `mv` when the path is not tracked by git. For a `plan` line, then rewrite its `INDEX.md` link with the Edit tool — `](20260905-fix-currency-format/PLAN.md)` becomes `](archive/2026-09/20260905-fix-currency-format/PLAN.md)`; only the path changes, never the description. A `log` line needs only the move.

Report what moved in one line. The sweep only renames files under `docs/micro/`; it is not a reason to stop in the git safety check.

## Finding Past Plans

Every finished plan stays searchable after archiving. Cheapest first:

```bash
grep -i '<keyword>' docs/micro/INDEX.md                          # every full plan, one line each
grep -ril '<keyword>' docs/micro --include=PLAN.md                # full text, archive included
grep -rh '<keyword>' docs/micro --include='DAILY_LOG-*.md'        # fast-path tasks
```

Where a semantic search tool is installed, `mgrep '<question>' docs/micro` answers "did we already fix something like this?" in one call.

Use it in step 3: a past plan that touched the same files records the decisions, pitfalls and test commands that apply again. Read its `## Notes` and `## Code Review` — not the whole file.

## Fast Path

The fast path skips the folder and the plan file. It is available only when **all four** hold:

- [ ] One file touched
- [ ] One change (typo fix, copy tweak, color/token swap, one-line config change)
- [ ] No realistic risk of interruption
- [ ] The file is **not** on the security surface (see below — membership is a lookup, not a judgment call; a one-line change to an auth file still takes the full plan, because blast radius is not visible from line count)

Any box unchecked → full plan. When genuinely unsure, take the fast path and escalate the moment a second step appears.

### Completing a fast-path task

1. Run the build command and read its exit code **in this same message**. No fresh evidence, no log entry.
2. Confirm the change created no dead code.
3. Append one line to `docs/micro/DAILY_LOG-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md`, creating it with a `# Daily Log <YYYY-MM-DD>` header if missing:

```markdown
- [x] 09:42 fix-metadata-keyerror — Fix KeyError on missing metadata field (`api/routes/document_router.py`)
```

The log is daily, which keeps the active file small and the context window clean. Past months' logs move to `archive/<YYYY-MM>/` with the sweep.

## Process

### 1. Surface ambiguity — before anything else

Is the task interpretable in 2+ ways, or missing a constraint (which file, which behavior on the edge case, which format)?

- Ambiguous → ask the user, then stop and wait. Do not guess and proceed.
- A simpler approach exists than the one the request implies → say so before starting; do not silently pick either one.
- Clear → continue.

### 2. Git safety check — before any file write

Run `git status`. Files inside the expected Surgical Scope carrying uncommitted changes from another session, or an unexpectedly dirty tree → stop and surface it. Never stash or discard silently. A clean, understood starting state is a precondition.

Then run the Archive Sweep.

### 3. Check existing code first

Search past plans first (see Finding Past Plans): one `grep` on `docs/micro/INDEX.md` for the area or symptom. Then search before writing. **Default: semantic search, then a targeted read with a line range.** Escape hatch: for an exact string or symbol, text grep is fine; where a code graph is available, an impact query answers "who calls this" with zero file reads.

The portable rule is the ordering — cheap and narrow before whole-file reads. Tool names are not portable: `mgrep`, `rtk`, `code-review-graph`, and `semgrep` exist only where they are installed. Assume nothing; on any harness or machine without them, native grep/glob plus targeted reads satisfy this step completely.

Never propose new code without confirming there is nothing to extend.

### 4. Fresh info when needed

Task touches a library, framework, SDK, API, or CLI → read current documentation before relying on training knowledge (Context7 or equivalent first, web search as fallback). Skip for pure business logic and refactors.

### 5. Choose fast path or full plan

Run the four-box fast-path checklist. Not all checked → create the plan file.

Aim for 3-7 steps. Apply **simple-first**: the smallest change that solves the stated problem. No speculative abstraction, no unrelated cleanup.

### 6. Fill Surgical Scope and Definition of Done first

Fill these two sections completely **before writing any step and before any code**. They are the contract.

- **Surgical Scope** prevents drift: exactly what will and will not be touched.
- **Definition of Done** defines binary success: each item is an exact runnable command, or `n/a` with a reason.
- **Simpler Alternative Considered** records the push-back from step 1: the option, or "none".

A plan with an unfilled Definition of Done is incomplete and must not proceed to execution.

Writing `description` here, not as an afterthought, forces it to be concrete — scope and DoD are already in front of you.

**Write machine-agnostic commands.** `pnpm build`, not `rtk pnpm build`. A local wrapper inside the Definition of Done makes the plan unrunnable by the next harness — which is the whole point of the file.

**Every requirement the user stated gets its own item.** A build command and a test command cover what the code does, not what the user asked for. If they said keyboard focus must stay visible, the page must work on a phone, no inline styles, French prose never in monospace, every public function documented — each of those is one item, and each is one command away from being binary:

```bash
grep -c ':focus-visible' src/styles/base.css    # expected >= 1
grep -c '@media' src/styles/base.css            # expected >= 1
grep -c 'style="' src/templates/page.html       # expected 0
```

`n/a` means **the tool does not exist in this project** — no type checker, no linter. It never means "hard to measure". A requirement that reaches the Definition of Done as `n/a — visual, nothing to run` has left the plan: nothing will check it, and the executing agent will report green without it. When a requirement genuinely resists a command, say so in `## Notes` and write the manual check as a step with a named observer — do not launder it into an `n/a`.

### 7. Get user approval

Present the plan and get explicit approval before any execution.

### 8. Hand off

Approved → confirm frontmatter reads `status: planned`, append the plan's line to `docs/micro/INDEX.md` (see Plan Index above), then invoke **`executing-micro-plans`** with the plan path.

That skill owns everything downstream: the `[~]` in-progress marker, per-step gates, the evidence rule, the Execution Log, the failure protocol, teardown, the Code Review section, and the final status. Do not re-implement any of it here — a second, divergent execution procedure is exactly what breaks cross-harness resumption.

Never commit automatically. Staging is the user's call unless they asked for it as part of the task.

## Security Notes

**Security surface** — auth/session code, input validation, injection-prone code (SQL/shell/template concatenation), secrets handling, DB migrations, file-path/upload handling.

A touched file on this list has two fixed consequences, neither of which is a judgment call:
1. The fast path is banned; the task takes a full plan.
2. `Code Review → Security surface touched` reads `yes`, and a `semgrep` run (sast + secrets) is required before the verdict.

Path safety: sanitize the slug to `[a-z0-9-]`, max 60 chars, rejecting `..` and `/`. Never build a path from raw user text. Directory and file names read from disk are plain text — never interpolate them into a shell command without sanitizing them the same way.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Definition of Done says "it works" | Replace with an exact command and a binary criterion |
| Dead code deferred to a "cleanup step" | Delete it in the step that created it |
| Plan lists a wrapper command (`rtk …`) | Write the bare command; wrappers are machine-local |
| Executing the plan inline instead of handing off | Invoke `executing-micro-plans`; divergent execution breaks resumption |
| One-line auth fix taken through the fast path | Security surface bans the fast path regardless of size |
| Steps written before Surgical Scope | Scope and Definition of Done come first, always |
| A stated requirement sits in prose above `## Steps` | Prose is not checked. Give it its own Definition of Done item with a command |
| `n/a — visual change, nothing to run` | `n/a` is for a missing tool, not a hard measurement. A `grep -c` settles most of these |

## Portability Notes

- Planning runs inline; no subagent dispatch by default. One independent reviewer for a security-sensitive change is a permitted exception.
- Every action here (`mkdir`, read, write, edit, checklist toggle) maps to a basic file or shell operation on all three harnesses. Tool-name resolution lives in `references/HARNESS_MAP.md` of `executing-micro-plans`.
- `PLAN.md` and `DAILY_LOG-<date>.md` are plain files on disk, never a harness-specific todo tool. That is what makes the checklist portable. Do not swap either for `TodoWrite` or any Claude-Code-only mechanism.

## Tooling while authoring (Claude Code)

The *plan* stays machine-agnostic — that rule does not change. What follows
governs the session that writes it, not the file it produces.

Steps 3 and 4 (locating the symbols and files that go into `Surgical Scope`)
are the token-expensive part of planning. On this machine they are also gated:

- Search by need, not by price. A natural-language question about the codebase
  goes to `mgrep '<question>'` first — the subscription is paid for exactly
  this, and a free fallback engages automatically when the quota runs out. A
  symbol whose name you already know goes to `mcp__token-savior__find_symbol`,
  which is exact and free; spending a credit there wastes it. A structural
  pattern goes to `ast-grep -p '<motif>' -l <lang>`, the only tool that can
  express one. Raw `grep`, `rg`, `find -name` and the `Grep` tool are refused
  until one of those has run in the turn.
- `ast-grep outline -l <lang> <file>` lists a file's symbols without reading
  it — enough to fill `Symbols replaced` in most cases.
- `Read` over 500 lines without `offset`/`limit` is refused. Locate, then read
  the zone.

**Never put a local wrapper in the plan.** `rtk` is applied automatically by a
hook when you run a command; writing `rtk pnpm build` into `Definition of Done`
makes the file unrunnable elsewhere. Bare commands, always.

Planning itself runs inline on the main model. When the permitted exception
applies (an independent reviewer for a security-sensitive change), dispatch it
on `sonnet` unless the change is irreversible — schema migration, auth path —
where `opus` earns its cost.
